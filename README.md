# arkserver
Docker image for a dedicated ARK Survival Evolved server in a Docker container.

* Built on [drpsychick/steamcmd](https://github.com/drpsychick/steamcmd) with the latest `steamcmd`
* Configuration via Environment Variables
* Easy crontab manipulation for automated backups, updates, daily restarts, weekly dino wipes, etc
* Simple volume structure for server files, config, logs, backups, etc
* Inherently includes all features present in `arkmanager`
* Optional [RCON health server](docs/HealthServer.md) for application-level readiness checks

## Quick Start

Pull the latest (or any other desired version):
```bash
docker pull drpsychick/arkserver:latest
```

To run a generic server with no configuration modifications:
```bash
$ docker run -d \
    -v steam:/home/steam/.steam/steamapps \  # mounted so that workshop (mod) downloads are persisted
    -v ark:/ark \  # mounted as the directory to contain the server/backup/log/config files
    -p 27015:27015 -p 27015:27015/udp \  # steam query port
    -p 7778:7778 -p 7778:7778/udp \  # gameserver port
    -p 7777:7777 -p 7777:7777/udp \ # gameserver port
    drpsychick/arkserver
```

If the exposed ports are modified (in the case of multiple containers/servers on the same host) the `arkmanager` config will need to be modified to reflect the change as well. This is required so that `arkmanager` can properly check the server status and so that the ARK server itself can properly publish its IP address and query port to steam.

* Uses [FezVrasta](https://github.com/FezVrasta)'s [arkmanager/ark-server-tools](https://github.com/arkmanager/ark-server-tools) for server management
* Forked from [thmhoag/arkserver](https://github.com/thmhoag/arkserver) (August 2022 — split after unaccepted PR)
